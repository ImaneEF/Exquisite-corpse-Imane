# A Dream

I have a dream that...

One day when I am hungry late at night, the fridge will be filled with tiramisu

In the future war will be an exception instead of the rule in the world

That people will help eachother unconditionally and without prejudicing.
<br>
That we'll live in harmony with the world and its creatures.
<br>
And that we may all stand as equals.
<br>

That we all find work as Data Scientist & AI experts
