# A Dream

I have a dream that...

One day when I am hungry late at night, the fridge will be filled with tiramisu
<br>
In the future war will be an exception instead of the rule in the world
<br> <br>
People will help eachother unconditionally and without prejudicing.
<br>
We'll live in harmony with the world and its creatures.
<br>
And that we may all stand as equals.
<br> <br>
Our houses will be levitating above the earth. 
<br>
There will be no countries and borders.
Energy will be produced out of trash. We will stop global warming.  
<br> <br>
We all find work as Data Scientist & AI experts
<br> <br>
The world will be filled with many robots that we'll be able to program 
<br>
The future will have less traffic
<br>
There is no stress anymore :smiley_cat:
<br> <br>
