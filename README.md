# A Dream

I have a dream that...

One day when I am hungry late at night, the fridge will be filled with tiramisu

In the future war will be an exception instead of the rule in the world

That people will help eachother unconditionally and without prejudicing.
<br>
That we'll live in harmony with the world and its creatures.
<br>
And that we may all stand as equals.
<br>

I dreamed that our houses will be levitating above the earth and there will be no countries and borders.  
Energy will be produced out of trash. We will stop global warming.  

That we all find work as Data Scientist & AI experts

A world with many robots that we'll be able to program 
<br>
A future with less traffic
<br>
And no stress :smiley_cat:
